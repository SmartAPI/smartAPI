This is where I got introduced to ontologies, Semantic Web and Linked Data that could be used to solve biological problems. That brought me to Germany where I pursued my PhD in Computer Science in the University of Leipzig. My focus was on consumption of Linked Data for healthcare, educational and economic research leveraging data quality. Then I got the opportunity to pursue my research ideas further as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in the Biomedical Informatics department. This is where I brought the worlds of Semantic Web and Biology together. After spending just a little over a year at Stanford, my professor got an opportunity to start a Data Science Institute at the University of Maastricht, Netherlands.
